# Manage your busy life

Introduction
-------
As a team of 4 we wanted to challenge ourselves, and build a task-manager app in a week, using React, Jest, Node.js, Express and Sequelize.  None of which any of us had used before.  Though the app is still a work in progress, I'm very proud of what we achieved in such a short space of time. Next steps will be to refactor, improve test coverage, and deploy via heroku.

Instructions
----
Note: You will need a postgres database named "task_development" set up to run this from your machine.


Download and run the app:
```
$ git clone git@github.com:malinnaleach/task-manager.git
$ cd task-manager
$ cd client
$ npm run start
```

Navigate to localhost:3000 to see the app in action and add some tasks!
